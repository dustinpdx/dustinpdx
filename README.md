- 👋 Hi, I’m @dustinpdx
- 👀 I’m interested in the confluence of art, technology, and anything that makes the world a better place.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to build on my experience in the professional world and bring it into my personal world for enjoyment... and vice-versa!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ideas on how to improve our lives with tech rather than be run by it!
- 📫 How to reach me ...
